# Beginner-Friendly Machine Learning Onboarding

Welcome to this hands-on machine learning onboarding project!  
This repository is designed for juniors, interns, or engineers with little or no experience in machine learning.  
Youâ€™ll work on three classic datasets, step-by-step, to discover the basics of ML workflows, data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.

## What Will You Learn?

- The basic concepts of machine learning
- How to explore and preprocess real-world data
- How to train and evaluate simple classification models
- How to interpret and visualize results

## Datasets Used

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
   Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on personal and ticket information.

2. **Palmer Penguins Classification**  
   Predict the species of a penguin from physical measurements.

3. **Iris Flower Classification**  
   Classify iris flowers among three species using petal and sepal dimensions.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone this repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DmHoly/ML_Starter.git
    cd ML_Starter
    ```
2. **Open the notebooks**
    - You can use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
    - All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Follow the step-by-step instructions in each notebook.**
    - Each notebook contains explanations, code cells to complete, and exercises.


## Who is this for?

- Beginners in machine learning
- Engineering interns or juniors
- Anyone curious about data science!

No previous ML experience required. Just a little Python helps!
